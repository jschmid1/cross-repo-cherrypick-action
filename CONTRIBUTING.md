### Build from source

Install the dependencies.

Apply the automatic formatting to the source code.

```
npm run format
```

Build and package the action for distribution.

```
npm run build && npm run package
```

### Testing

```
npm test

Shorthand for format, build, package and test.

### Releases

The distribution is hosted in this repository under `dist`.
Simply build and package the distribution and commit the changes to publish a new snapshot version.

To release a version, run the [Release](https://github.com/jschmid1/cross-repo-cherrypick-action/actions/workflows/release.yml) workflow from the branch that should be released.
This sets the release version and tags the release commit.
It also creates/moves the major and minor tags (e.g. `v1` and `v1.2`) to the latest corresponding release as [officially recommended](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md).
